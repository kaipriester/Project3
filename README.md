# Tropical Storm Detector: 
## Analyzing NOAA Offshore Florida Buoy Data to Find Past Hurricanes

__Problem:__
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) moored buoys are essentially
sea weather stations. These stations collect a massive amount of data on the hourly oceanographic environment. They transit data on the wave height and period, barometric pressure, temperatures, and wind. As you can imagine, this data is essential to meteorology, environmental studies, and climate sciences. One valuable data set is wind gust recordings. Wind gusts are great indicators of tropical storms. If there are recorded wind gusts greater than 75mph (65 knots) then the buoy is likely in a hurricane. The wind data from the buoy is recorded real time approximately every ten minutes. There is an archive of this data, and the goal is to capture the k greatest recorded wind gusts greater than 75mph.

__Motivation:__
It is very valuable to detect hurricanes offshore before they hit land masses because it allows
time for safety preparations.

__Features:__
The application should be able to load in the wind data and return the k top datetimes with the highest wind gust using two different data structures/algorithms.
